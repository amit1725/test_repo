The goal of my project is to create a user-friendly food delivery application using the MERN stack. It aims to offer a seamless experience for users to browse menus, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time while providing restaurant administrators with efficient tools to manage menus, orders, and deliveries. The application enhances the food delivery experience through efficient order processing and robust system performance.
